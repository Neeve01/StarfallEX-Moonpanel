It's a panel, written in moon language. As inspired by The Witness, a game by Thekla Inc.

To install, run `npm install`.
Make sure you have gulp-cli installed globally.

To build, run `gulp moon`.
To watch, run `gulp watch`.

To run, copy the entire `moonpanel` directory into your garrysmod/data/starfall folder, load a test panel and try it out.

Thanks to Bytewave for making the buildscript.
I guess.
