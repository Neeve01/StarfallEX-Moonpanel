# StarfallEX-Moonpanel
It's a panel, written in moon language. As inspired by The Witness, a game by Thekla Inc.

Currently supports suns, colors, triangles, hexagons and disjoints. Allows for symmetry puzzles. 

Right now it doesn't understand neither the Polyomino rule, nor the Y-symbol rule. This is yet to be implemented in future!

To install, get Node.js, and run `npm install` in this directory.
Make sure you have gulp-cli installed globally.

To build, run `gulp moon`.
To watch, run `gulp watch`.

To run, copy the entire `moonpanel` directory into your garrysmod/data/starfall folder, load a test panel and try it out.

Thanks to Bytewave for making the buildscript.
I guess.
